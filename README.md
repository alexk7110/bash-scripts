# bash-scripts
My small collection of helper bash scripts for gdrive, youtube and others

<b>youtube</b>
This is a simple one-line script that uses Lynx text browser, Perl and VLC to create a local playlist that VLC can play out of your favorite or personal YouTube playlist. In order for this to work visit your prefered playlist on YouTube and copy, paste to this script the id of you list found on the url bar of your web browser after the https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list= part.
Keep in mind that you will have to make this an executable by issuing the "$ chmod +x youtube" command on your terminal.

<b>gdd</b>
A simple bash script that uses the gdrive app found at https://github.com/prasmussen/gdrive in order to search for and download files from Google Drive. You can also upload files to a specific folder once you replace the uploadFolder variable on the top of the script with the id of your prefered upload folder found on GDrive URL after the https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/ path.
